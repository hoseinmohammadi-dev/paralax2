                    <h3>PICK A TOOL <br>AND STICK TO IT</h3>
                    <p>Every image generator has its own visual style, so using the same prompt across different tools can produce completely different results. This variability makes it hard to iterate quickly or maintain consistency across a project. The fastest way to get reliable, usable outputs is to pick one tool and learn how it behaves. Once you're familiar with its quirks, you’ll spend less time troubleshooting and more time creating.</p>

                    <h3>EVERY WORD <br>MATTERS</h3>
                    <p>When crafting prompts, brevity is key. The more words you add, the more diluted your intent becomes.  Most tools have token limits anyway so focus on the words that directly affect composition, subject, or style, and cut the rest. Clear, intentional prompts lead to faster and more consistent results.</p>

                    <h3>USE CALLBACKS</h3>
                    <p>If you're working with multiple characters or recurring elements, assign a unique name or label to each one. AI models can easily lose track of who’s who without consistent reference points. Assign a name or tag to each character and reuse it every time they appear in your prompt to reduce visual drift. It might feel overly structured, but it’s the best way to keep things visually consistent across images.</p>
